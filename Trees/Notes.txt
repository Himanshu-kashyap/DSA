Depth first traversal O(n) : extra space requirements => O(h)  (h = max height of tree)
	inorder
	preorder 
	postorder

Breadth first traversal O(n)   : extra space requirements => O(w)  (w = max width of tree)
	Level order

Diameter of Tree :
	Max distance b/w 2 leaf nodes

	It is biggest of : 
		Diameter of left subtree
		Diameter of right subtree
		left height of node + right height of node

	Diameter fxn complexity = O(n)	
	height compl :  as we are going to each node : O(n)




=====================  Heap
Heap: 
	level order traversal
	O(nLogn) : sorting
